## Usage 

## API MongoDB

This server is built using Express.js and MongoDB as the database. The main processes in the database are creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from different collections.

### Connection to MongoDB

The server connects to MongoDB using the Mongoose ODM library. The connection is established using the `mongoose.connect()` function with the URI stored in the `process.env.MONGO_URI` environment variable. The options `{ useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }` are passed to the function to ensure compatibility with the MongoDB driver.

### Environment Variables

In the `server` folder of the repository, create a `.env` file with the following line:
MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGO_API_URI>
Replace `<YOUR_MONGO_API_URI>` with your own MongoDB Atlas API URI.
